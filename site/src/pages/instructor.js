                    <p>Train the trainer sessions are a starting point for volunteers of all backgrounds
                        to gather in a space and learn what goes into a Morgan Stanley Makerspace session.
                        There will be a presentation of the curriculum, the opportunity to gain some hands
                        on experience with the CPX device, and a discussion of the philosphy with which we
                        run our makerspaces.</p>
                    <p />
                    <p>The Morgan Stanley Makerspaces are designed to introduce participants to coding
                        and making with the Adafruit CPX device as a starting platform.</p>
                    <p />
                    <p>The philosophy is one of discovery, experimentation and passion. The curriculum
                        is not used as a test or a required standard to achieved, but a jumping off point.</p>
                    <p />
                    <p>We hope that by the end of the session, the participants will have cultivated a
                        desire to delve deeper and learn more about whichever aspect of technology inspired them.</p>
