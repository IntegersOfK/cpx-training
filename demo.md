# Demo Talking Points

- As you can see, the CPX has lots of sensors and lights to play with

- In 2018, we found the younger kids were interested in the CPX the older kids worked with

- We created two programs with the CPX in order to include the younger kids in the fun

- MakeCode - block based coding

- CircuitPython - Python based coding

## MakeCode

- Our curriculm is on our the website

- which is open source and freely available for use

- Click on Curriculum where we have all of our workshops

- Go to the MakeCode workshops

- appropriate grades for this workshop is 5-7

- All of our sessions are here but for this demo we just need to go to the MakeCode Editor

- Start a New Project

- You can see:
    - Device Simulator
    - Forever Loop in the code editor
    - Code Block Categories

- I'm going to make the device turn on lights when I Shake it so I go to input and select Shake

- Just an easy drag and drop

- Make the lightsOn variable

- easy right click options

- now I need to set the lights to turn on and off

- and add the lightsOn variable

- I use colors other than red and green in case a student is color blind

- Name and save

- The code is downloaded as firmware to my host computer

- Plug in the CPX

- Shows up as a UBS drive and I'll drag and drop to load it

- You don't have to download to device to test

- Since we are using shake we can see shake is on the device simulator

- If students prove to be more advanced they can look at the Javascript editor

- Read through code and make changes, like how I'm going to adjust the color in Hexidecimal

- Lets go back to see the Blocks color has changed to purple

- Download the update to the device


## CircuitPython

- Go to the website

- Select CircuitPython

- Lets choose the Acceleronmeter exercise

- Plug in the CPX

- Shows up as a USB drive with some files in it

- we are going to edit the main.py

- opens automatically when we open Mu editor

- Copy and paste from the website

- Save and the CPX reloads with the new code

- Select Serial and you immediately see the device return data

- Select Plotter and you see the data on a graph

- Mu is made for CircuitPython and is a great teaching IDE
