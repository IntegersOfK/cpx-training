However, to engage them at a deeper level of\r\n                            understanding of Computer science, so that they can evaluate, produce, and critique new technology,\r\n                            we needed to get creative. We needed to introduce electronics and programming in a highly tangible\r\n                            way early in the education. This led us to the combination of two of the best of breed technologies:\r\n                            Adafruit's Microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi's laptop-computer. Specifically, Raspberry Pi 400 and\r\n                            Adafruit CPX (often used by employees to teach their own children to code) - to transform these young\r\n                            consumers of technology into self-sufficient, digital citizens, who recognize they can be creators of\r\n                            technology.\"\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <cite>Kumar Vadaparty</cite>\r\n                    </blockquote>\r\n                    <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The MS Makerspace program came into my life at exactly the right time. After many years of helping\r\n                            my own children learn robotics through extracurricular programs like the First Lego League, I wanted\r\n                            to take what I had learned and share it with children who might not have otherwise have access. Our\r\n                            MS Makerspace workshops have created the perfect opportunity. Teaching kids who stand to benefit the\r\n                            most from the right mentorship has been such a fulfilling experience. If we continue to leverage the\r\n                            collective knowledge of our Technology organization, I believe we can continue to make a big difference\r\n                            in kids' lives by inspiring and igniting a passion for technology.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <cite>Dinesh Doshi</cite>\r\n                    </blockquote>\r\n                    <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            MS Makerspaces embody what it means to Give Back through skills-based volunteerism.
