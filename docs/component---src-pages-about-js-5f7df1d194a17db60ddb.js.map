MS Makerspaces allow technologists to share this discovery\r\n                            with children who might otherwise not have the opportunity.

My goal is to\r\n                            contribute to MS Makerspaces growth to reach more communities and children. The gift of education\r\n                            really makes a difference and the feeling is extremely rewarding.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <cite>Augusto Ramirez</cite>\r\n                    </blockquote>\r\n                    <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The MS Makerspace program came into my life at exactly the right time. After many years of helping\r\n                            my own children learn robotics through extracurricular programs like the First Lego League, I wanted\r\n                            to take what I had learned and share it with children who might not have otherwise have access. Our\r\n                            MS Makerspace workshops have created the perfect opportunity. Teaching kids who stand to benefit the\r\n                            most from the right mentorship has been such a fulfilling experience. If we continue to leverage the\r\n                            collective knowledge of our Technology organization, I believe we can continue to make a big difference\r\n                            in kids' lives by inspiring and igniting a passion for technology.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <cite>Dinesh Doshi</cite>\r\n                    </blockquote>\r\n                    <blockquote>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            MS Makerspaces embody what it means to Give Back through skills-based volunteerism.
